<hr />

**Rojo** is a tool designed to enable Roblox developers to use professional-grade software engineering tools.

With Rojo, it's possible to use industry-leading tools like **Visual Studio Code** and **Git**.

Rojo is designed for power users who want to use the best tools available for building games, libraries, and plugins.

## Features
Rojo enables:

* Working on scripts and models from the filesystem, in your favorite editor
* Versioning your game, library, or plugin using Git or another VCS
* Streaming `rbxmx` and `rbxm` models into your game in real time
* Packaging and deploying your project to Roblox.com from the command line

In the future, Rojo will be able to:

* Sync instances from Roblox Studio to the filesystem
* Automatically convert your existing game to work with Rojo
* Import custom instances like MoonScript code
