## Version Control
By building your game (or just the scripts) as individual files on the filesystem, it becomes easy to start using professional-grade version control tools like [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com).

Hundreds of thousands of companies and individual developers use Git to version their software projects. With Rojo, Roblox developers can take advantage of the best collaboration tool around.

Using a repository hosting service like GitHub or GitLab brings powerful features to Roblox developers like code reviews and issue tracking that professional engineers can't live without.

TypeScript enables static type safety, which helps prevent typos and adds unparalleled autocompletion. It also brings features like arrow functions, object destructuring, functional programming methods, and more!

With Rojo, you can use [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.github.io) to compile TypeScript to Lua and take advantage of a huge ecosystem of TypeScript tooling.

It's also possible to use other languages that compile to Lua like [MoonScript](https://moonscript.org) and [Haxe](https://haxe.org).
