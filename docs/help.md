Rojo is a fairly complex tool to adopt, but there's a community willing to help!

The [Roblox Open Source Community Discord](https://discord.gg/wH5ncNS) currently hosts a Rojo support channel, **#rojo**, that is a great place to get help as problems come up.

If you find anything that looks like a bug or have ideas for how to improve Rojo, feel free to file an issue on [Rojo's GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/issues).

Rojo's primary maintainer is also available on Twitter, [@LPGhatguy](https://twitter.com/LPGhatguy).
