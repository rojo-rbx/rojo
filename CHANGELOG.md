# Rojo Changelog

## Unreleased Changes
* Support for a `$schema` field in all special JSON files (`.project.json`, `.model.json`, and `.meta.json`) ([#974])
* Projects may now manually link `Ref` properties together using `Attributes`. ([#843])
 	This has two parts: using `id` or `$id` in JSON files or a `Rojo_Target` attribute, an Instance
    is given an ID. Then, that ID may be used elsewhere in the project to point to an Instance
    using an attribute named `Rojo_Target_PROP_NAME`, where `PROP_NAME` is the name of a property.

    As an example, here is a `model.json` for an ObjectValue that refers to itself:

    ```json
    {
        "id": "arbitrary string",
        "attributes": {
            "Rojo_Target_Value": "arbitrary string"
        }
    }
    ```

    This is a very rough implementation and the usage will become more ergonomic
    over time.

* Updated Undo/Redo history to be more robust ([#915])
* Added popout diff visualizer for table properties like Attributes and Tags ([#834])
* Updated Theme to use Studio colors ([#838])
* Improved patch visualizer UX ([#883])
* Added update notifications for newer compatible versions in the Studio plugin. ([#832])
* Added experimental setting for Auto Connect in playtests ([#840])
* Improved settings UI ([#886])
* `Open Scripts Externally` option can now be changed while syncing ([#911])
* The sync reminder notification will now tell you what was last synced and when ([#987])
* Fixed notification and tooltip text sometimes getting cut off ([#988])
* Projects may now specify rules for syncing files as if they had a different file extension. ([#813])
 	This is specified via a new field on project files, `syncRules`:

 	```json
 	{
 	 	"syncRules": [
 	 	 	{
 	 	 	 	"pattern": "*.foo",
 	 	 	 	"use": "text",
                "exclude": "*.exclude.foo",
 	 	 	},
 	 	 	{
 	 	 	 	"pattern": "*.bar.baz",
 	 	 	 	"use": "json",
 	 	 	 	"suffix": ".bar.baz",
 	 	 	},
 	 	],
 	 	"name": "SyncRulesAreCool",
 	 	"tree": {
 	 	 	"$path": "src"
 	 	}
 	}
 	```

 	The `pattern` field is a glob used to match the sync rule to files. If present, the `suffix` field allows you to specify parts of a file's name get cut off by Rojo to name the Instance, including the file extension. If it isn't specified, Rojo will only cut off the first part of the file extension, up to the first dot.

    Additionally, the `exclude` field allows files to be excluded from the sync rule if they match a pattern specified by it. If it's not present, all files that match `pattern` will be modified using the sync rule.

 	The `use` field corresponds to one of the potential file type that Rojo will currently include in a project. Files that match the provided pattern will be treated as if they had the file extension for that file type. A full list is below:

 	| `use` value    | file extension  |
 	|:---------------|:----------------|
 	| `serverScript` | `.server.lua`   |
 	| `clientScript` | `.client.lua`   |
 	| `moduleScript` | `.lua`          |
 	| `json`         | `.json`         |
 	| `toml`         | `.toml`         |
 	| `csv`          | `.csv`          |
 	| `text`         | `.txt`          |
 	| `jsonModel`    | `.model.json`   |
 	| `rbxm`         | `.rbxm`         |
 	| `rbxmx`        | `.rbxmx`        |
 	| `project`      | `.project.json` |
 	| `ignore`       | None!           |

    **All** sync rules are reset between project files, so they must be specified in each one when nesting them. This is to ensure that nothing can break other projects by changing how files are synced!

## [7.4.1] - February 20, 2024
* Made the `name` field optional on project files ([#870])

	Files named `default.project.json` inherit the name of the folder they're in and all other projects
    are named as expect (e.g. `foo.project.json` becomes an Instance named `foo`)

    There is no change in behavior if `name` is set.

## [7.4.0-rc1] - October 3, 2023
### Additions
#### Project format
* Added support for `.toml` files to `$path` ([#633])
* Added support for `Font` and `CFrame` attributes ([rbx-dom#299], [rbx-dom#296])
* Added the `emitLegacyScripts` field to the project format ([#765]). The behavior is outlined below:

	| `emitLegacyScripts` Value | Action Taken by Rojo                                                                                             |
	|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
	| false                     | Rojo emits Scripts with the appropriate `RunContext` for `*.client.lua` and `*.server.lua` files in the project. |
	| true   (default)          | Rojo emits LocalScripts and Scripts with legacy `RunContext` (same behavior as previously).                      |


	It can be used like this:
	```json
	{
		"emitLegacyScripts": false,
		"name": "MyCoolRunContextProject",
		"tree": {
			"$path": "src"
		}
	}
	```

* Added `Terrain` classname inference, similar to services ([#771])

	`Terrain` may now be defined in projects without using `$className`:
	```json
	"Workspace": {
		"Terrain": {
			"$path": "path/to/terrain.rbxm"
		}
	}
	```

* Added support for `Terrain.MaterialColors` ([#770])

	`Terrain.MaterialColors` is now represented in projects in a human readable format:
	```json
	"Workspace": {
		"Terrain": {
			"$path": "path/to/terrain.rbxm"
			"$properties": {
				"MaterialColors": {
					"Grass": [10, 20, 30],
					"Asphalt": [40, 50, 60],
					"LeafyGrass": [255, 155, 55]
				}
			}
		}
	}
	```

* Added better support for `Font` properties ([#731])

	`FontFace` properties may now be defined using implicit property syntax:
	```json
	"TextBox": {
		"$className": "TextBox",
		"$properties": {
			"FontFace": {
				"family": "rbxasset://fonts/families/RobotoMono.json",
				"weight": "Thin",
				"style": "Normal"
			}
		}
	}
	```

#### Patch visualizer and notifications
* Added a setting to control patch confirmation behavior ([#774])

	This is a new setting for controlling when the Rojo plugin prompts for confirmation before syncing. It has four options:
    * Initial (default): prompts only once for a project in a given Studio session
    * Always: always prompts for confirmation
    * Large Changes: only prompts when there are more than X changed instances. The number of instances is configurable - an additional setting for the number of instances becomes available when this option is chosen
    * Unlisted PlaceId: only prompts if the place ID is not present in servePlaceIds

* Added the ability to select Instances in patch visualizer ([#709])

	Double-clicking an instance in the patch visualizer sets Roblox Studio's selection to the instance.

* Added a sync reminder notification. ([#689])

	Rojo detects if you have previously synced to a place, and displays a notification reminding you to sync again:

	![Rojo reminds you to sync a place that you've synced previously](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40185666/242397435-ccdfddf2-a63f-420c-bc18-a6e3d6455bba.png)

* Added rich Source diffs in patch visualizer ([#748])

	A "View Diff" button for script sources is now present in the patch visualizer. Clicking it displays a side-by-side diff of the script changes:

	![The patch visualizer contains a "view diff" button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40185666/256065992-3f03558f-84b0-45a1-80eb-901f348cf067.png)

	![The "View Diff" button opens a widget that displays a diff](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40185666/256066084-1d9d8fe8-7dad-4ee7-a542-b4aee35a5644.png)

* Patch visualizer now indicates what changes failed to apply. ([#717])

	A clickable warning label is displayed when the Rojo plugin is unable to apply changes. Clicking the label displays precise information about which changes failed:

	![Patch visualizer displays a clickable warning label when changes fail to apply](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40185666/252063660-f08399ef-1e16-4f1c-bed8-552821f98cef.png)


#### Miscellaneous
* Added `plugin` flag to the `build` command that outputs to the local plugins folder ([#735])

	This is a flag that builds a Rojo project into Roblox Studio's plugins directory. This allows you to build a Rojo project and load it into Studio as a plugin without having to type the full path to the plugins directory. It can be used like this: `rojo build <PATH-TO-PROJECT> --plugin <FILE-NAME>`

* Added new plugin template to the `init` command ([#738])

	This is a new template geared towards plugins. It is similar to the model template, but creates a `Script` instead of a `ModuleScript` in the `src` directory. It can be used like this: `rojo init --kind plugin`

* Added protection against syncing non-place projects as a place. ([#691])
* Add buttons for navigation on the Connected page ([#722])

### Fixes
* Significantly improved performance of `rojo sourcemap` ([#668])
* Fixed the diff visualizer of connected sessions. ([#674])
* Fixed disconnected session activity. ([#675])
* Skip confirming patches that contain only a datamodel name change. ([#688])
* Fix Rojo breaking when users undo/redo in Studio ([#708])
* Improve tooltip behavior ([#723])
* Better settings controls ([#725])
* Rework patch visualizer with many fixes and improvements ([#713], [#726], [#755])

## [7.0.0-rc.3] - October 19, 2021
This is the last release candidate for Rojo 7. In an effort to get Rojo 7 out the door, we'll be freezing features from here on out, something we should've done a couple months ago.

Expect to see Rojo 7 stable soon!

* Adjusted Studio plugin colors to match Roblox Studio palette. ([#482])
* Improved experimental two-way sync feature by batching changes. ([#478])

## 7.0.0-rc.2 - October 19, 2021
(Botched release due to Git mishap, oops!)

## [7.0.0-rc.1] - August 23, 2021
In Rojo 6 and previous Rojo 7 alphas, an explicit Vector3 property would be written like this:

```json
{
    "className": "Part",
    "properties": {
        "Position": {
            "Type": "Vector3",
            "Value": [1, 2, 3]
        }
    }
}
```

For Rojo 7, this will need to be changed to:

```json
{
    "className": "Part",
    "properties": {
        "Position": {
            "Vector3": [1, 2, 3]
        }
    }
}
```

The shorthand property format that most users use is not impacted. For reference, it looks like this:

```json
{
    "className": "Part",
    "properties": {
        "Position": [1, 2, 3]
    }
}
```

* Major breaking change: changed property syntax for project files; shorthand syntax is unchanged.
* Added the `fmt-project` subcommand for formatting Rojo project files.
* Improved error output for many subcommands.
* Updated to stable versions of rbx-dom libraries.
* Updated async infrastructure, which should fix a handful of bugs. ([#459])
* Fixed syncing refs in the Roblox Studio plugin ([#462], [#466])
* Added support for long paths on Windows. ([#464])

## [7.0.0-alpha.4][7.0.0-alpha.4] (May 5, 2021)
* Added the `gameId` and `placeId` optional properties to project files.
    * When connecting from the Rojo Roblox Studio plugin, Rojo will set the game and place ID of the current place to these values, if set.
    * This is equivalent to running `game:SetUniverseId(...)` and `game:SetPlaceId(...)` from the command bar in Studio.
* Added "EXPERIMENTAL!" label to two-way sync toggle in Rojo's Roblox Studio plugin.
* Fixed `Name` and `Parent` properties being allowed in Rojo projects. ([#413][pr-413])
* Fixed "Open Scripts Externally" feature crashing Studio. ([#369][issue-369])
* Empty `.model.json` files will no longer cause errors. ([#420][pr-420])
* When specifying `$path` on a service, Rojo now keeps the correct class name. ([#331][issue-331])
* Improved error messages for misconfigured projects.

## [7.0.0-alpha.3][7.0.0-alpha.3] (February 19, 2021)
* Updated dependencies, fixing `OptionalCoordinateFrame`-related issues.
* Added `--address` flag to `rojo serve` to allow for external connections. ([#403][pr-403])

[7.0.0-alpha.3]: https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v7.0.0-alpha.3

## [7.0.0-alpha.2][7.0.0-alpha.2] (February 19, 2021)
* Fixed incorrect protocol version between the client and server.

[7.0.0-alpha.2]: https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v7.0.0-alpha.2

## [7.0.0-alpha.1][7.0.0-alpha.1] (February 18, 2021)
This release includes a brand new implementation of the Roblox DOM. It brings performance improvements, much better support for `rbxl` and `rbxm` files, and a better internal API.

* Added support for all remaining property types.
* Added support for the entire Roblox binary model format.
* Changed `rojo upload` to upload binary places and models instead of XML.
    * This should make using `rojo upload` much more feasible for large places.
* **Breaking**: Changed format of some types of values in `project.json`, `model.json`, and `meta.json` files.
    * This should impact few projects. See [this file][allValues.json] for new examples of each property type.

Formatting of types will change more before the stable release of Rojo 7. We're hoping to use this opportunity to normalize some of the case inconsistency introduced in Rojo 0.5.

## [6.0.0 Release Candidate 1](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v6.0.0-rc.1) (March 29, 2020)
This release jumped from 0.6.0 to 6.0.0. Rojo has been in use in production for many users for quite a long times, and so 6.0 is a more accurate reflection of Rojo's version than a pre-1.0 version.

* Added basic settings panel to plugin, with two settings:
    * "Open Scripts Externally": When enabled, opening a script in Studio will instead open it in your default text editor.
    * "Two-Way Sync": When enabled, Rojo will attempt to save changes to your place back to the filesystem. **Very early feature, very broken, beware!**
* Added `--color` option to force-enable or force-disable color in Rojo's output.
* Added support for turning `.json` files into `ModuleScript` instances ([#308](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/pull/308))

* The server half of **experimental** two-way sync is now enabled by default.
* Increased default logging verbosity in commands like `rojo build`.
* Rojo now requires a project file again, just like 0.5.4.

## [0.6.0 Alpha 3](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v0.6.0-alpha.3) (March 13, 2020)
* Added `--watch` argument to `rojo build`. ([#284](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/pull/284))
* Added dark theme support to plugin. ([#241](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/issues/241))
* Added a revamped `rojo init` command, which will now create more complete projects.
* Added the `rojo doc` command, which opens Rojo's documentation in your browser.
* Fixed many crashes from malformed projects and filesystem edge cases in `rojo serve`.
* Simplified filesystem access code dramatically.
* Improved error reporting and logging across the board.
    * Log messages have a less noisy prefix.
    * Any thread panicking now causes Rojo to abort instead of existing as a zombie.
    * Errors now have a list of causes, helping make many errors more clear.

## [0.6.0 Alpha 2](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v0.6.0-alpha.2) (March 6, 2020)
* Fixed `rojo upload` command always uploading models.

This is a general maintenance release for the Rojo 0.5.x release series.

* Updated reflection database and other dependencies.
* First stable release with binaries for macOS and Linux.

## [0.6.0 Alpha 1](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v0.6.0-alpha.1) (January 22, 2020)

### General
* Added support for nested project files. ([#95](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/issues/95))
* Added project file hot-reloading. ([#10](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/issues/10)])
* Fixed Rojo dropping Ref properties ([#142](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/issues/142))
    * This means that properties like `PrimaryPart` now work!
* Improved live sync protocol to reduce round-trips and improve syncing consistency.
* Improved support for binary model files and places.

### Command Line
* Added `--verbose`/`-v` flag, which can be specified multiple times to increase verbosity.

* Removed support for legacy `roblox-project.json` projects, deprecated in an early Rojo 0.5.0 alpha.
* Rojo no longer traverses directories upwards looking for project files.
    * Though undocumented, Rojo 0.5.x will search for a project file contained in any ancestor folders. This feature was removed to better support other 0.6.x features.

### Roblox Studio Plugin

* Added "error" state to show errors in a place that isn't the output panel.
* Improved diagnostics for when the Rojo plugin cannot create an instance.

## [0.5.3](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v0.5.3) (October 15, 2019)
* Fixed an issue where Rojo would throw an error when encountering recently-added instance classes.

## [0.5.2](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v0.5.2) (October 14, 2019)

## [0.5.1](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v0.5.1) (October 4, 2019)
* Fixed an issue where Rojo would drop changes if they happened too quickly ([#252](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/issues/252))
* Improved diagnostics for when the Rojo plugin cannot create an instance.
* Updated dependencies
    * This brings Rojo's reflection database from client release 395 to client release 404.

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v0.5.0) (August 27, 2019)

    * Rojo will emit a warning when `Name` is specified and does not match the name from the file.
* Fixed `Rect` values being set to `0, 0, 0, 0` when synced with the Rojo plugin. ([#201](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/issues/201))

* Added `.meta.json` files
    * `init.meta.json` files replace `init.model.json` files from Rojo 0.4.x ([#183](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/pull/183))
    * Other `.meta.json` files allow attaching extra data to other files ([#189](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/pull/189))
* Added support for infinite and NaN values in types like `Vector2` when building models and places.
    * These types aren't supported for live-syncing yet due to limitations around JSON encoding.

* `Content` propertyes can now be specified in projects and model files as regular string literals.
* Added support for `BrickColor` properties.
* Added support for properties added in client release 384, like `Lighting.Technology` being set to `"ShadowMap"`.
* Improved performance when working with XML models and places
* Fixed serializing empty `Content` properties as XML
* Fixed serializing infinite and NaN floating point properties in XML
* Improved compatibility with XML models
* Plugin should now be able to live-sync more properties, and ignore ones it can't, like `Lighting.Technology`.

## 0.5.0 Alpha 10

* Fixed error being thrown when trying to unload the Rojo plugin.
* Added partial fix for [issue #141](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/issues/141) for `Lighting.Technology`, which should restore live sync functionality for the default project file.

## [0.5.0 Alpha 6](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v0.5.0-alpha.6) (March 19, 2019)

* Rojo now throws an error if no project file is found. ([#63](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/issues/63))
* Fixed multiple sync operations occuring at the same time. ([#61](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/issues/61))
* Partitions targeting files directly now work as expected. ([#57](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/issues/57))

## [0.4.4](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v0.4.4) (April 7, 2018)
* Fix small regression introduced in 0.4.3

## [0.4.3](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v0.4.3) (April 7, 2018)
* Plugin now automatically selects `HttpService` if it determines that HTTP isn't enabled ([#58](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/pull/58))
* Plugin now has much more robust handling and will wipe all state when the server changes.
    * This should fix issues that would otherwise be solved by restarting Roblox Studio.

## [0.4.2](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v0.4.2) (April 4, 2018)
* Fixed final case of duplicated instance insertion, caused by reconciled instances not being inserted into `RouteMap`.
    * The reconciler is still not a perfect solution, especially if script instances get moved around without being destroyed. I don't think this can be fixed before a big refactor.

## [0.4.1](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v0.4.1) (April 1, 2018)
* Merged plugin repository into main Rojo repository for easier tracking.
* Improved `RouteMap` object tracking; this should fix some cases of duplicated instances being synced into the tree.

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v0.4.0) (March 27, 2018)
* Protocol version 1, which shifts more responsibility onto the server
    * This is a **major breaking** change!
    * The server now has a content of 'filter plugins', which transform data at various stages in the pipeline
    * The server now exposes Roblox instance objects instead of file contents, which lines up with how `rojo pack` will work, and paves the way for more robust syncing.
* Added `*.model.json` files, which let you embed small Roblox objects into your Rojo tree.
* Improved error messages in some cases ([#46](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/issues/46))

## [0.3.2](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v0.3.2) (December 20, 2017)
* Fixed `rojo serve` failing to correctly construct an absolute root path when passed as an argument
* Fixed intense CPU usage when running `rojo serve`

## [0.3.1](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v0.3.1) (December 14, 2017)
* Improved error reporting when invalid JSON is found in a `rojo.json` project
    * These messages are passed on from Serde

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v0.3.0) (December 12, 2017)
* Factored out the plugin into a separate repository
* Fixed server when using a file as a partition
    * Previously, trailing slashes were put on the end of a partition even if the read request was an empty string. This broke file reading on Windows when a partition pointed to a file instead of a directory!
* Started running automatic tests on Travis CI (#9)

## [0.2.3](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v0.2.3) (December 4, 2017)
* Plugin only release
* Tightened `init` file rules to only match script files
    * Previously, Rojo would sometimes pick up the wrong file when syncing

## [0.2.2](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v0.2.2) (December 1, 2017)
* Plugin only release
* Fixed broken reconciliation behavior with `init` files

## [0.2.1](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v0.2.1) (December 1, 2017)
* Plugin only release
* Changes default port to 8000

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v0.2.0) (December 1, 2017)
* Support for `init.lua` like rbxfs and rbxpacker
* More robust syncing with a new reconciler

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases/tag/v0.1.0) (November 29, 2017)
* Initial release, functionally very similar to [rbxfs](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/rbxfs)
